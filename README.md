# Electrostatics Solver

Third year Theoretical Physics group project to solve electrostatics problems.


### Folder Structure

##### bin
The bin directory is where the output executables are stored. It is listed in .gitignore so that it is not included in the git repository. (You generate it along with the compiled executables by running make.)

##### build
Like the bin directory, the build directory is not included in the git repository but is automatically generated by running make. It contains the compiled (but not linked) .o object files.

##### include
All header files should be in the include folder. 

##### src
The src folder is for all c++ source files. These should all have the file extension .cpp (so that that make can find them).

##### test
Contains a src folder which contains the tests for the program. Running make testAll also generates a build and bin directory here, with the test executable in the test/bin directory.

##### cfg
Contains the config files that specify the problems to solve.



### Config file format

Config files are saved with a .cfg extension and are in the cfg directory. Each line is a command, with the first word being the command name, and the following words being the arguments. Arguments should be seperated by a space and must not contain spaces themselves. All commands and arguments must be lowercase.

#### Comments
Any line starting with a # is a comment, and is ignored by the program.
```
# This is a comment
```

#### Defining a new unsolved system
new systemName xMin xMax yMin yMax
```
# A new unsolved system called problem1 with grid size xMin=-300 xMax=300 yMin=-100 yMax=100
new problem1 -300 300 -100 100
```

#### Adding boundary conditions to an unsolved system
All position coordinates and grid sizes must be integers. Radiuses and potentials can be doubles.

##### Points
```
point xPosition yPosition potential
```

##### Rings - not filled
```
ring centreX centreY radius potential 
```

##### Circles (/cylinders) - filled
```
circle centreX centreY radius potential
```

##### Lines
```
line x1 y1 x2 y2 potential
```

##### Plates
Sets the potential for a plate at the specified edge of the system.
```
left potential
right potential
top potential
bottom potential
```

##### Rectangle - not filled
A rectangle with edges parallel to the edges of the system.
```
ractangle leftBoundary rightBoundary topBoundary bottomBoundary potential
```

#### Solving methods
Solving an unsolved system does not change it, so it is easy to solve the same unsolved system many times with different methods.

##### Biconjugate Gradient - Eigen
Biconjugate Gradient method from Eigen library.
```
# Solves the unsolved system called unsolved storing the result in a new solved system called solved
solveeigenbicon unsolved solved
```

##### SparseLU - Eigen
Sparse LU method from Eigen library.
```
# Solves the unsolved system called unsolved storing the result in a new solved system called solved
solveeigensparselu unsolved solved
```

##### Biconjugate Gradient - ViennaCL
Biconjugate Gradient method from the ViennaCL library.
```
# Solves the unsolved system called unsolved storing the result in a new solved system called solved
solveviennabicon unsolved solved
```

##### Iterative method
An iterative method simmilar to that used for heat flow over time with a specified number of iterations.
```
# Solves the unsolved system called unsolved storing the result in a new
# solved system called solved with 1000 iterations
solveiterative unsolved solved 1000
```

#### Analytical solutions
Analytics solutions for the first and second problems are hard coded into the program.
```
# The analytical solution for problem 1, stored in a solved system called
# p1analytical with grid size as above and inner cylinder radius 20,
# outer ring radius 90, inner cylinder potential 0, outer ring potential 100
analytical1 p1analytical -300 300 -100 100 20 90 0 100

# As above for problem 2 with a left plate voltage of 50, right plate at -50
# and cylinder radius 90 (always at 0V)
analytical2 p2analytical -300 300 -100 100 50 -50 90
```

#### Saving results

##### Saving the potential at every point for a solution
Stored in a matrix like format that is easy to plot with gnuplot. The file will have the same name as the system.
```
savesolution solvedsystemname
```

##### Saving a comparison between two solved systems
Saves the absolute difference between the two systems at each point to a matrix like format the same as for savesolution.
```
savecomparison systemnamea systemnameb outputfilename
```

##### Saving electric field
Stored as a list of points of the form:
x y dx dy
The file has the same name as the system but appended with "field". Eg solvedsystemnamefield in the example below.
```
savefield solvedsystemname
```

#### Timing steps in the config files
Any steps in the config files can be timed. Multiple timers can be running at one time. The elapsed total CPU time is printed to the standard output stream along with the timer name with the timer is stopped.
```
starttimer wholefiletimer
DO STUFF
starttimer solvetimer
SOLVE THE SYSTEM HERE
stoptimer solvetimer
stoptimer wholefiletimer
```

#### Plotting results

##### Opening a plot file
Before plots can be selected, a plot file must be generated as follows:
```
# A plotfile with grid xMin=-300 xMax=300 yMin=-100 yMax=100 called plots.plt
plotfile plots.plt -300 300 -100 100
```

##### Plain plot of system potentials / difference plot etc
The system must be saved with savesolution first.
```
plot systemname
```

##### Plot with field arrows
The system and field must be saved with savesolution and savefield first.
```
fieldplot systemname arrowspacing
```

##### Plot with equipotential lines
The system must be saved with savesolution first.
```
contourplot systemname
```


### Compiling and Running

To compile and run the program you must have g++, make, ViennaCL and Eigen installed. Eigen is the library used to provide matrices. There are options to solve the matrices with either Eigen of ViennaCL.  To compile the unit tests you must install the Google Test framework. Gnuplot is needed to generate the .eps plots. The installation commands below should work on Debian based linux distributions such as Ubuntu, Mint etc. 

##### Installing g++ and make
```bash
sudo apt-get install g++ make
```

##### Installing Eigen, ViennaCL and Gnuplot
NOTE: Using the latest version of ViennaCL from their website caused problems, but the version installed by apt-get seems to work fine!
```bash
sudo apt-get install libeigen3-dev libviennalcl-dev gnuplot
```

##### Compiling
In the root directory of the project run make -j. This will generate the object files in the build directory, and the output executable in the bin directory. To complie with multicore support run make openMP -j. The -j tells make to use multiple threads when compiling, which saves a lot of time.
```bash
make -j
```

##### Running the Program
The compiled program is call electrostatics and is in the bin directory. Running the program generates the necessary data files and a gnuplot .plt file as specified in the config file used. It takes one config file as an argument. The program can be run for the different problems as shown below (example for problem 1).
```bash
cd bin
./electrostatics ../cfg/problem1.cfg
gnuplot p1plots.plt
```

This will generate the plots as eps files that can then be opened with a program like gv. You will need gnuplot installed to generate the plots.


### Compiling and running the unit tests

##### Installing Google Test
```
sudo apt-get install cmake libgtest-dev
cd /usr/src/gtest
sudo cmake CMakeLists.txt
sudo make
sudo cp *.a /usr/lib
```

##### Compiling and running the tests
With google test installed as directed above the tests can be compiled by running
```bash
make testAll
```
in the project root directory. This also compiles any other source files required for running the tests.
The tests can then be executed by running
```bash
test/bin/testAll
```
